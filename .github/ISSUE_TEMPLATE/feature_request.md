**Before submitting**

Please check our [Contributing](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) because some feature requests are asked _a lot_ and there are good reasons (as explained on the wiki) why we can't (yet) implement them or why we won't implement them.

**Describe the feature**

A clear and concise description of what the feature request/enhancement is. What is the goal of adding this feature request? This should include java snippets.

**Describe the target audience**

Describe which programmers and/or which kinds of programs would benefit from your feature proposal. If the feature proposal interacts with a library that isn't part of the core java libraries, link to this project.

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the feature / enhancement here.
