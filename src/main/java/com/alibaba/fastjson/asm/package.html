	Provides a small and fast bytecode manipulation framework.

	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.objectweb.org/asm">ASM</a> framework is
		organized around the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor
		ClassVisitor}, {@link org.objectweb.asm.FieldVisitor FieldVisitor} and
		{@link org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor} interfaces,
		which allow one to visit the fields and methods of a class, including
		the bytecode instructions of each method.
	<p>In addition to these main interfaces, ASM provides a {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class, that can parse an
		existing class and make a given visitor visit it. ASM also provides a
		{@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class, which is a
		visitor that generates Java class files.
	<p>
		In order to generate a class from scratch, only the {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class is necessary. Indeed,
		in order to generate a class, one must just call its visit<i>XXX</i>
		methods with the appropriate arguments to generate the desired fields
		and methods. See the "helloworld" example in the ASM distribution for
		more details about class generation.
	<p>In order to modify existing classes, one must use a {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class to analyze the
		original class, a class modifier, and a {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} to construct the modified
		class. The class modifier is just a {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor} that delegates most of
		the work to another {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor
		ClassVisitor}, but that sometimes changes some parameter values, or
		call additional methods, in order to implement the desired
		modification process. In order to make it easier to implement such
		class modifiers, ASM provides the {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.ClassAdapter ClassAdapter} and {@link
		org.objectweb.asm.MethodAdapter MethodAdapter} classes, which
		implement the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor} and
		{@link org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor} interfaces by
		delegating all work to other visitors. See the "adapt" example in the
		ASM distribution for more details about class modification.
	<p>
		The size of the core ASM library,
		<tt>asm.jar</tt>
		, is only 42KB, which is much smaller than the size of the <a
			href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel">BCEL</a> library (504KB), and
		than the size of the <a href="http://serp.sourceforge.net">SERP</a>
		library (150KB). ASM is also much faster than these tools. Indeed the
		overhead of a load time class transformation process is of the order
		of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with SERP
		(see the
		<tt>test/perf</tt>
		directory in the ASM distribution)! @since ASM 1.3
